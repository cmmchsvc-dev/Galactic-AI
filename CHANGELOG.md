# Changelog — Galactic AI

All notable changes to Galactic AI are documented here.

---

## [v1.0.5] — 2026-02-21

### Added
- **🔌 Agent Loop Circuit Breaker** — After 3 consecutive tool failures (errors or timeouts), the AI is forced to stop calling tools and explain the situation to the user instead of spiraling through all 50 turns
- **⚠️ Progressive Backpressure** — At 50% and 80% of the tool-turn budget, the AI receives nudge messages telling it to wrap up and deliver results, preventing runaway automation sessions
- **🔄 Tool Repetition Guard** — If the same tool is called 4+ times in a 6-call window without progress, the AI is instructed to change strategy or explain the problem
- **🔒 Model Lock During Active Tasks** — Switching models via the Control Deck while the AI is mid-task now queues the switch instead of disrupting the active conversation (applied automatically after the task completes)
- **🎯 Smart Routing Restoration** — When smart routing temporarily switches to a specialized model (e.g., Qwen Coder for coding tasks), the original model is now automatically restored after the request completes

### Fixed
- **Agent timeout spiral** — Complex tasks (like script creation) could burn through all 50 tool turns without converging, hitting the 600s wall-clock timeout. The new anti-spin guardrails (circuit breaker, backpressure, repetition guard) prevent this pattern
- **Smart routing model leak** — `auto_route()` switched the model but never restored it, so the specialized model stuck around for subsequent unrelated requests

---

## [v1.0.4] — 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- **🔧 Model persistence across restarts** — Selected primary model now survives restarts. Two bugs were causing the model to revert to Gemini 2.5 Flash on every startup:
  1. `/api/switch_model` (used by the Models tab quick-switch) updated the live session only — it never wrote the selection to `config.yaml`. It now calls `ModelManager._save_config()` so the choice is immediately persisted.
  2. `GalacticGateway.__init__` read `config.gateway.model` which was only written by the Settings tab path, not the Models tab path. It now reads `config.models.primary_model` first (the canonical value written by `ModelManager`), falling back to `config.gateway.model`, so startup always loads the correct last-used model regardless of which UI element made the switch.

---

## [v1.0.3] — 2026-02-21

### Added
- **🎤 Voice Input Button** — Microphone button in the Control Deck chat bar. Click to record, sends audio to Whisper (OpenAI/Groq) for transcription, inserts text into the chat input automatically
- **🔥 Auto Windows Firewall Rule** — On startup with `remote_access: true`, Galactic AI automatically adds a Windows Firewall inbound rule allowing TCP traffic on the Control Deck port (private networks only)
- **"CONTROL DECK" label** in the top bar next to the model status badge

### Fixed
- **Remote access HTTP mode** — Server now binds to `0.0.0.0` on plain HTTP instead of HTTPS with self-signed TLS. Self-signed certs caused `ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE`. JWT authentication still protects all remote API endpoints
- **Updater em dash encoding** — Fixed `update.ps1` parse error caused by em dash character corruption in some environments

---

## [v1.0.2] — 2026-02-21

### Added
- **Localhost bypass for remote auth** — Local connections from `127.0.0.1`/`::1` bypass JWT auth so the PC is never locked out of the Control Deck when `remote_access: true`
- **"CONTROL DECK" label** in top bar (first introduced here, improved in v1.0.3)

### Fixed
- **QR code compatibility** — QR pairing code now uses standard black-on-white colors with higher error correction (`ERROR_CORRECT_H`)
- **Test Voice button now plays audio** — Previously only generated the MP3 server-side without streaming it back. Now uses `/api/tts` to stream audio bytes to the browser and plays them directly
- **Desktop shortcut icon** — `galactic_ai_flux_v4.ico` added to the repository (was missing, referenced by `create_shortcut.ps1`)

---

## [v1.0.1] — 2026-02-21

### Added
- **Config auto-migration** — On startup, `load_config()` detects missing config sections from newer versions and adds them with safe defaults. Affected sections: `gmail`, `discord`, `whatsapp`, `webhooks`, `web`, `elevenlabs`, `models`, `tool_timeouts`, `aliases`. Existing values are never overwritten
- **Updater `-Force` flag** — `.\update.ps1 -Force` and `./update.sh --force` re-download even when the installed version matches the latest release

### Fixed
- Missing release ZIP assets — Added `windows.zip`, `macos.zip`, `linux.tar.gz`, `universal.zip`, and `SHA256SUMS.txt`

---

- **`remote_access.py`** — New security module centralizing JWT, rate limiting, CORS, and auth middleware

  - `switch_to_primary()` no longer short-circuits when already in primary mode
  - `_save_config()` now syncs gateway provider/model in config.yaml for persistence across restarts

### Changed
